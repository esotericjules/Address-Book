# Address-Book
My ALC2.0 final project

Hi, I'm Juliet Onyekaoha, a front-end developer living in Lagos, Nigeria.

I enrolled in the ALC 2.0 course, to improve my skills, and for the final challenge I'm to create an Address Book App with the following functionality;

-User should be able to add contact
-User should be able to see list of contact names
-On clicking a contact name, the details of the contact should be displayed
-User should be able to edit a contact's details
-User should be able to delete a contact's details

To create the app I'm to use only HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript and Jquery.
