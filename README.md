# Address-Book
My ALC2.0 Take a climb challenge

For my final project in the ALC 2.0 web beginner track program, I was asked to build an Address Book with HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript, without any frameworks or libraries.
The functionality in the Address Book I built included
- User can be able to add contacts
- User can be able to see the list of contacts
- On clicking on a contact name, the details of the contacts(which includes, the phone number, email and home address) would be displayed
- User can be able to edit contact
- User can be able to delete contact.

I built the Address Book to be a single page Application that is simple and easy for an ordinary user to manage and utilize.
